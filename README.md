# DS_1_Spot_theScam_Hackathon
Anvesh Hackathon June Edition 2025- DS-1 Spot the Scam - Flag the Fraudulent Job Postings

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Spot the Scam: Job Posting Fraud Detection
Online job platforms are increasingly targeted by scammers. Fake job listings waste time and pose serious risks to users' money and personal data.
This project builds a machine learning system that detects fraudulent job posts and offers interactive insights through a Streamlit dashboard.


# Results

**F1-Score  | 0.99 **

**Classification Report (per class):**

| Metric    | Class 0 (Not Fraudulent) | Class 1 (Fraudulent) |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Precision | 1.00                     | 0.99                 |
| Recall    | 0.99                     | 1.00                 |
| F1-Score  | 0.99                     | 0.99                 |
| Support   | 2723                     | 2722                 |

**Confusion Matrix**
           |   Predicted
           |   0    |  1
Actual  0  | 2699   | 24

This means :

| Term                     | Meaning                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **True Negatives (TN)**  | 2699 ‚Üí Correctly predicted as **not fraudulent** (class 0)     |
| **False Positives (FP)** | 24 ‚Üí Incorrectly predicted as **fraudulent** when actually not |
| **False Negatives (FN)** | 6 ‚Üí Predicted as **not fraudulent**, but actually fraudulent   |
| **True Positives (TP)**  | 2716 ‚Üí Correctly predicted as **fraudulent** (class 1)         |


Key takeaways:

Precision:

0: 100% of predicted non-fraudulent jobs were actually non-fraudulent.

1: 99% of predicted fraudulent jobs were actually fraudulent.

Recall:

0: 99% of all actual non-fraudulent jobs were correctly predicted.

1: 100% of all actual fraudulent jobs were correctly caught.

F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall ‚Üí both classes have 0.99, which is outstanding.
